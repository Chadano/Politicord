# The constitution of Politicordia 

We the people of Discord feel like we can do a better job at governing than our nation's governments across the globe. Here we present a realistic system of a running, functioning, working model government where we will uphold the vision of our democracy.

## Article 1: Elections and Government

1.1 - Any member who joins this discord server is immediately elected as a local representative for wherever they are. Be it there house, bedroom or planet. They are a member of congress.

1.2 - Congress DECIDES the Chancellor, this system is seen in nations such as Germany. A chancellor must receive 50% + 1 votes (a majority) to become the chancellor. The chancellor's role is similar to that as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom or the Chancellor of Germany.

1.3 - The chancellor must be a leader of a political party. No independents can become chancellor.

1.4 - A chancellor is elected every week on the Friday. 

1.5 - Chancellors can run for re-election any number of times.

1.6 - A chancellor should appoint two cabinet members (Secretary of State and Secretary of Treasury), these cabinet members do not necessarily need to be from within their own party as coalitions between parties can occur.

1.7 - The role of the secretary of Treasury is to set out plans for the economy for the term. The budget reading is expected every Sunday.

1.8 - A snap election can be called with 51% of the house voting against the sitting Chancellor 


## Article 2: Political Parties

2.1 - Political parties have free reign on how they govern themselves, and how their leader is (or is not) elected

2.2 - To join a political party the leader of the party must give express permission for you to join. 

2.3 - Members of a political party are recommended, but not required to follow the parties stances when voting on legislation.

2.4 - There are, and always will be 4 political parties, 1 for each axis of the political compass.

2.5 - Political parties may occasionally need to form coalitions to get legislation passed. 

## Article 3: Constitution

A constitutional amendment requires a 2/3rds Congressional majority.

### Ammendment 1

Chancellor is now elected in a run off system. Multiple candidates from the same party (or independents) can run. The candidate with the least vote in a round is eliminated until one remains.

### Ammendment 2

The chancellor is now elected in a STV system. The two candidates with the most votes are "safe". If unpopular candidates from the same party are eliminated then their votes will go to the party candidate who is safe. If not then they can endorse a candidate to get their votes.

### Ammendment 3

If a Chancellor receives over 2/3rds  disapproval during a vote of no confidence in Congress (67%) then the chancellor MUST resign and a snap election (not involving the ousted chancellor) must begin.
